## Project Description

This Java project simulates the functionality of a stovetop with burners using enumerated types. The project includes classes to represent burners with various settings and temperatures. It provides a simulation of the passage of time and displays the status of the burners on the stove.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following classes:

- `Setting`: An enumeration representing burner settings.
- `Burner`: A class representing individual burners with temperature and setting control.
- `Stove`: A class that displays the status of all burners on the stove and handles the simulation.

## Usage

To run the stove simulation, you can create instances of the `Stove` class and interact with the burners using the provided methods. The simulation will display the status of the burners and the HOT BURNER ALERT if any burner is in BLAZING state.
